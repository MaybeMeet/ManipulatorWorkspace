The "GenerateManipWorkspace.m" file generates a three dimensional graphical representation of any n-DOF serial robotic manipulator workspace by taking a Dh-Table as an input. It also computes the transformation matrix of the end effector with respect to it's base and the Jacobian matrix.

Two plots are generated, the first represent a point cloud whereas the second represent the workspace boundaries. 

An example of 3-DOF RPP Manipulator is included for demonstation purposes
