# ManipulatorWorkspace

The "GenerateManipWorkspace.m" file generates a three dimensional graphical representation of any n-DOF serial robotic manipulator workspace by taking a Dh-Table as an input. It also computes the transformation matrix of the end effector with respect to it's base and the Jacobian matrix.

Two images are included in order to demonstrate an example.
